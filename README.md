# Description
A Mixxx controller mapping containing some improvements to the default Pioneer DDJ SX configuration.

## Improvements
- no shift on needle search while track is playing
- shift-jog-tick speed magnifier works on vinyl mode
- default beat jump size on start up
- improved jog wheel controls allowing spinback
- Deck 3 and 4 button mapping hooks (available to use now, but currently unset)

## Things TODO
- BPM slider catch (at the moment bpms are immediately set which may cause large bpm jumps if the current BPM slider position does not match with the value indicated in software)
  - this can be replicated by switching between decks 3 and 4 and mucking with the bpm slider, or by using sync.
- Serato like effect mapping?
